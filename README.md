# IFO - ParkChain

The Initial Farm Offering (IFO) flow involves the launch of new tokens through a decentralized fundraising mechanism. 
In this process, users can participate by committing their CAKE tokens to a specific IFO pool. Once the IFO event 
concludes, the smart contract determines the token allocation based on the individual's contribution relative to 
the total pool size. Participants receive the newly issued tokens in proportion to their committed CAKE tokens. 
The IFO process provides an opportunity for users to invest in new tokens at an early stage and supports the growth 
of innovative projects within this ecosystem.
